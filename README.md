# Django Girls Tutorial Project

This project is part of my effort to learn how real-world web applications are built using Django.

I started this project because I realized that while I was learning DSA, solving LeetCode problems, exploring machine learning, and studying full-stack development, I wasn’t getting enough hands-on experience. I wanted to actually build something, not just study.

To do that, I decided to follow the [Django Girls Tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/) to help me understand how code is written and structured in real-world projects. I'm not building this from scratch on my own, but rather learning by doing — writing code myself instead of copy-pasting, and understanding each step in the process.

Once I finish this project, I hope to have a solid grasp of:
- Django basics (views, templates, models, etc.)
- How full-stack components connect together
- Realistic workflows in software development

This project is part of my broader goal to become job-ready by building projects alongside my theoretical learning.
